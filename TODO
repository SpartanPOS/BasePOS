#non-exhaustive list of tasks

Implement workers:
    They will need to:
        handle and store JWT tokens
        authenticate with auth0
        
        store cacheable features onto the device so it is a PWA

Cleanup code:
    code is messy and doesnt follow any code standards
    use ESLINT for this?

Finish implementing modules.
    will need to dynamically import modules using full path instead of just their name



Add more tasks to TODO list:
    self explanatory
